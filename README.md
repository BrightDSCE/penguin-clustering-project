# penguin-clustering-project.
This project involved clustering a dataset of penguins to group species effectively and facilitate improved data analysis and recording.
Below is a detailed overview of the steps and methodologies used:

**Data Preprocessing:**
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and standardizing features to ensure optimal performance of the clustering algorithm.
Encoded categorical variables to numerical values and scaled the data to maintain uniformity across all features.

**K-Means Clustering:**
Built a K-Means model to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Used the Elbow Method and analyzed inertia to identify the point where adding more clusters no longer significantly reduces the within-cluster variance.

**Final Statistical DataFrame:**
Created a final DataFrame containing the original features alongside the assigned cluster labels.
